title: Running New Relic's Ignite Program, Part 1 - Hiring
date: 2023-06-26 10:24 -0700
---
Ignite is New Relic's early career engineering incubator program, which hires
new engineers into what is usually their first software engineering role, gives
them some extra onboarding and support, sets up rotations with various
engineering teams throughout the company, and then places them on one of those
teams as we find a good match. This is the first in a series of articles
walking through all the details of how it operates, from start to finish. It is
intended primarily as a resource for those who are running (or planning to run)
similar programs. Of course, it may also be interesting to folks thinking of
applying to the program! Each part will cover one of the phases each Ignite
engineer goes through: hiring, program onboarding, team rotations, team
placement and onboarding, and follow up. Since this is the first part, we're
starting at the beginning with hiring.

Hiring for an early career role is significantly different than hiring for a
more senior position. For mid- to lead-level roles, the challenge is finding
qualified candidates. You can do a lot of pre-sorting based on resumes to see
if they have the needed experience, and you'll likely end up with only a
handful of folks (at most) that you'd consider bringing in for a final
interview. The "best of the best" are almost never on the job market, so
working connections and active recruiting are critical.

For early career roles, though, almost everybody looking for an entry level
role is on the open job market, and there are far, far more candidates coming
up through universities, code schools, and other backgrounds eager for their
first engineering job than there are positions to go around. Sifting through
applications is like drinking from a firehose, and the challenge is processing
the sheer volume of candidates and narrowing it down to the most promising
folks. Every time we open a round of hiring for Ignite, the volume of
applicants goes up -- as of this writing, it's about 100 per day.

## Before You Start

### Take Notes

Before you do anything else, I recommend creating a document for recording
notes, observations, and feedback about how the program is going. It's
particularly valuable to track anything that didn't work well, anything that
worked _really_ well, or any ideas you have for ways to improve. That way, when
you periodically look back to iterate on the program, you'll have a list of
things to change or adjust going forward.

### The Job Description

There's a lot of great advice out there about writing inclusive job
descriptions, so I won't repeat it here. Make sure that you do some reading on
that topic, though, and consider using automated tools to review the text. You
can check out New Relic's ASE job description to see what we came up with.

### Work with Talent Acquisition

Make sure you go over the full process with your Talent Acquisition team (or
Recruiting, or whatever your office calls this group). They'll be the first
point of contact with your candidates, and will be setting up interview
schedules and such. They need to be able to explain the process, get the right
people in the right interviews, and so on.

### Set Up an Interview Panel

Speaking of interviews, since there's no specific existing team being hired
into, there's no automatic group of folks to do the interviewing. For each
round of Ignite hiring, we set up a group of engineers and managers to both
evaluate take-home exercises and conduct in-person interviews. You could call
for volunteers, draw from the teams being considered for placement, hand-pick a
specific panel, or otherwise handle this in whatever way seems best for your
organization. Make sure you have all the necessary skills represented in your
panel (see below for the various sorts of interview sessions we conduct). Once
you have your full set of interviewers, it's good to let them know about how
many interviews they should expect, over what period of time. We usually aim
for about 3 interviews per interviewer plus 1 training session, over a period
of around 3 weeks, so the burden on any individual is fairly light. It'll
depend on how many applicants you have and how many interviewers for each type
of interview session, though. You can start doing this around the time the
position becomes available for applications -- it'll take a little time for
candidates to get to the interview phase.

## The Hiring Process

When creating the Ignite hiring process, the specific traits we designed it to
select for are:

  * **Basic coding skills.** Candidates should be able to produce working,
    tested code from scratch at at least a basic level.
  * **Communication skills (written and verbal).** These are critical to
    long-term success as a software engineer, but often underemphasized in many
    hiring processes.
  * **Empathy and teamwork.** Research shows that the most productive teams are
    those with psychological safety and mutual respect.

In addition, there were a number of principles we strove to incorporate into the
process:

  * Bring in as diverse a candidate pool as possible.
  * As much as feasible, create objective standards and minimize bias.
  * Minimize the stress and anxiety of the interview process and provide a
    positive candidate experience.
  * Respect candidates' time and minimize the amount of "take-home" work involved.
  * Provide actionable feedback to all candidates.

Some of the measures we took toward those goals include:
  * All active recruiting for the Ignite program occurs with organizations
    centered around underrepresented groups. Everybody is welcome to apply,
    but this is where we focus our active recruiting efforts.
  * People of all backgrounds are encouraged to apply, including college
    graduates, bootcamp graduates, or folks who are self-taught or come from
    nontraditional backgrounds. Ideally, we'd love to see a mix of all of these
    in the program.
  * We use what we call a "progressive take-home exercise." The initial
    take-home exercise is simple enough for an early career engineer to
    complete in about an hour, and the final coding interview adds a feature to
    the originally submitted code.
  * We allow a choice of multiple take-home exercises, and also a variety of
    additional features to add, so that each candidate can choose the type of
    work that will best showcase their own strengths and experience.
  * Take-home exercises are anonymized, so the evaluator does not know whose
    exercise they are evaluating.
  * We publish all of our behavioral interview questions publicly and
    specifically share them with all candidates ahead of time.
  * Each step in the interview process has a defined evaluation rubric with
    specific criteria and a scoring guide. Feedback to the hiring manager is
    done by filling out the feedback form.
  * After review by the manager, all feedback forms are provided to the
    candidate, whether they continue through the process or not, so that they
    can see exactly where they missed the mark and what to work on for next
    time.
  * Before conducting any interviews, all interviewers receive training on how
    to conduct the interview and what sort of feedback to leave in the form.
    For example, if a candidate did not do well in a particular area, the
    interviewer should suggest ways that area could have been improved, rather
    than just marking it as poorly done. They also receive written guidebooks
    covering the same material.

Ignite's overall hiring process is structured as a funnel, like many others. At
each step throughout the funnel, we're looking to filter out about 50-70% of
remaining candidates, in order to arrive at a manageable number of finalists. We
want to move segments that take a lot of time to evaluate or for candidates to
complete later in the process, and front load the less time intensive exercises,
both to keep our workload reasonable and to respect candidates' time. As such,
we've settled on the following steps for the Ignite interview process.

  * Application
  * Hiring Manager Screen
  * Take Home Exercise
  * Final Interview

This has worked for us so far, but as the number of applicants keeps growing,
we may find we need to add additional steps early in the process or become much
more strict in our evaluations at some point, in order to maintain a manageable
volume of candidates in the later (more time intensive) phases of the process.

### Application

The initial application consists of a resume, an optional cover letter, and a
short answer question.

#### Resume

In the Ignite program, it's usually the candidate's first engineering job, and
we're specifically looking for candidates from diverse backgrounds. As such, we
don't weigh resumes as highly for Ignite positions as we might for more senior
roles. That said, there are a few things that will make a resume stand out for
us, such as signs of completed software projects, or job experience in other
fields that might be relevant or valuable in software engineering. For example,
teaching experience is a good sign, anything with math or especially statistics
is very good, and any programming-adjacent work such as design or product
management is also a plus. None of these things are necessary, though.

#### Cover Letter

Having a cover letter is not required (at all), but we'll read it if it's
there. Since cover letters take time for the candidate to write, and time for
us to read and evaluate, we suggest candidates only include one if there's
something specific they really want to tell us that can't be said elsewhere in
the application. A great cover letter is a small plus, but a generic one is
neutral at best, and a poorly written cover letter can be a significant
negative. So, most Ignite applications would probably be better off leaving it
out. That said, candidates should be aware that opinions about cover letters
vary widely -- for some roles, hiring managers strongly prefer they be
included.

#### Short Answer Question

Answers should be three paragraphs at most -- a concise style is one of the
specific things we're looking for. We only ask one short answer question in our
application form:

> "Tell us about a technical project you’ve worked on. Explain the details of
> how it worked, and describe at least one trade-off you considered. Please
> keep your response to no more than 2-3 paragraphs."

With this question, we want to see that candidates can take complex ideas and
break them down clearly in a way that non-experts could understand. After
reading the project description, a reviewer should come away knowing what was
built, why it was built that way, and roughly what all the moving pieces were.
Also, the project described should be technical in some sense, but need not be
a software project -- building a camera or some other complicated project would
also be fine, as long as there's some technical depth to the topic. Perfect
grammar and punctuation aren't required, but the ability to clearly express
complex ideas is.

In particular, the directions ask for trade-offs, so we want to see at least
one trade-off described. An application that does not include any trade-offs is
unlikely to proceed. A trade-off should have at least two plausible choices
with pluses and minuses on both sides. "We didn't have time for everything, so
we focused on X" is not a trade-off, because having infinite time is not an
option. "We only had time to implement either feature X or feature Y. We went
with X because [reasons]" is an ok trade-off description, but not great. A
great description of a trade-off might look something like this: "We had to
choose option X or option Y. X is better at [things], but Y is better for
[other things]. [Something] was the most important consideration for us,
because [reasons], so we went with X." This could be about architectural
styles, libraries, databases, or any other decision that had multiple
reasonable options that the candidate had to choose between. Experienced
engineers are almost always thinking about trade-offs like this as they design
and build their systems.

### Hiring Manager Screen

The Hiring Manager Screen consists of a light technical exercise and an
opportunity for the candidate to ask any questions they may have about the
program. The technical exercise will be on about a FizzBuzz level of
difficulty, but it won't actually be FizzBuzz. Candidates have 15 minutes, can
write their solution in any IDE and any language they like, and are free to use
Google or look up API documentation (though we do ask that they don't look up
the exact literal solution to the exercise).

If a candidate is not able to complete the technical screen, or if there are
any behavioral red flags, we explain to them why they will not be continuing
through the interview process and thank them for their time.

If a candidate successfully completes the exercise and will be continuing, then
we'll walk through what the rest of the interview process will look like and
what kind of timeline to expect. If applicable, we let them know that since we
do anonymized batches of code evaluations, we may need to wait for a full batch
to come in before evaluating their submission, so to expect some delay before
hearing back.

As a side note, this is probably one of the most stressful steps for
candidates, and I would love to avoid it if possible. However, for early career
engineers coming into their first programming job, we've found that we _must_
test for the fundamental building blocks of programming, such as loops,
conditionals, and the most basic data structures like lists and maps.
Understandably, it's very difficult for a new engineer to judge whether their
technical skills are ready for that next step into a professional position, and
many candidates need a bit more time to firmly establish those building blocks
when they first apply. While we were initially more lenient with this
interview, the later technical elements of the hiring process are more
challenging, and what we have found over the years is that if a candidate
struggles at this step, those struggles will increase going forward. It is not
a kindness to put somebody in a position where they will not be successful, so
I recommend being clear about what is required to advance and firm in those
requirements.

### Take-Home Exercise

We specifically want a diverse set of backgrounds, and unlike most programming
jobs, there is no specific type or style of code that we will be focusing on in
this role. So, in the Ignite program we offer two different choices of
exercise, so that candidates can choose the one that will best showcase their
specific experience and strengths. One of the exercises focuses on React and
CSS, and the other is a small command-line tool.

All exercises are evaluated based on a strict rubric with very specific
criteria, and the broad outline of those criteria are described in the text of
the exercise.

Exercises are also evaluated anonymously, so evaluators have no identifying
information about the candidate when they review the code. We have two ways to
handle anonymization, depending on the situation. Ideally, have one person
anonymize each entry, and have somebody else do the evaluation. That way, you
can evaluate each submission as it comes in. It's also possible for one person
to handle everything themselves by collecting batches of 3-5, anonymizing them,
and then doing all the evaluations. You'll need a way to anonymize and
deanonymize the submissions in that case - we use a small command-line script
for this purpose.

### Final Interview

#### Interviewer Preparation and Logistics

We have a training/kickoff meeting with all the interviewers before anybody
starts interviewing. In brief, these are the areas we cover:

  * Our overall hiring philosophy, as described in the "Hiring" section above.
  * Legal restrictions around topics that may not be discussed or asked about.
  * Walk through the interview process and the feedback forms.
  * Remind everybody to be kind and thoughtful -- interviewing is very
    stressful, and this may be some candidates' first job interviews.

In addition to the initial training, we also send out an email to each
interviewer the day before they interview, which will contain links to the
Interviewer Guidebook and the feedback form for that specific candidate. The
feedback form is a Google Docs spreadsheet with one page for each interviewer,
plus a page with instructions and a scoring guide.

We always aim to have two interviewers in each session, if possible -- one
primary and one observer. The observer will mostly just be observing, but if
there's something they really want to say, or if the candidate wants to ask
them a question, that's ok. Interviewers should generally observe at least a
couple times before being primary for any given type of session. We also try to
have at least one interviewer in each session who identifies as a member of an
underrepresented group (as optionally indicated in our interviewer signup
form).

After all the interviewers have submitted their feedback for a candidate, the
hiring manager reviews all the feedback left and ensures it is appropriate to
share with the candidate. In other words, all of the written comments are kind,
any areas to improve are clearly spelled out, no proprietary information is
included, etc. The feedback form is then sent back to the candidate, and we let
them know if they will be considered in our final selection. If they are, we
let them know the expected timeline for the final decision.

#### Interview Sessions

We want to respect the candidate's time, as well as our interviewers', so the
final interview stage consists of three 45 minute sessions with a 15 minute
break between each one. Each of these sessions is described below.

##### Technical Session

Similarly to the code challenge, we want to mitigate the stress of interviewing
as much as possible, and give our candidates as much opportunity to shine as we
can. So, for the technical interview, we start with the code they've already
submitted, since it's guaranteed to be a domain and codebase they're familiar
with. We also let them choose from several different features to implement, and
allow them to look up whatever they like online (aside from the literal exact
solution to the exercise).

##### Behavioral Session

This is a behavioral interview with "Tell me about a time when…" style
questions. We worked with our ERGs to develop the specific questions, but
they're mostly fairly typical of this style of interview.

We provide the full text of the questions to all candidates - in fact, they're
published on our website. To some extent, like many of our practices, this is
to mitigate the stress of interviewing. However, we've also found that this
provides a better hiring signal for any given candidate. Typically, folks have
a handful of stories they always tell in response to these kinds of questions,
and the third or fourth time they tell that story is always way more polished
than the first time. We don't want to select for whether they happen to have
already been asked a similar question a couple times in the past, and we don't
want to know about just whatever example they could come up with under pressure
in the heat of the moment. We want to know their best example of a given
behavior, described as well as they can describe it, and publishing the
questions ahead of time helps us achieve that.

##### Verbal Communication Session

We provide the following prompt to the candidate ahead of time, so that they
have a chance to think about what topic they'd like to explain and practice
walking through it if they like:

> "Please explain a technical topic of your choice. It doesn't necessarily need
> to be about computers, but computer related topics are often a good choice.
> What we're specifically looking for is your ability to take complex abstract
> concepts, break them down, and explain them clearly. You're welcome to use
> informal visual aids if you like, but please do not have any prepared slides
> or materials ahead of time. When we used to do these in person, we encouraged
> folks to use a whiteboard, and you're welcome to use anything that's
> basically equivalent, though it's also fine if you'd prefer not to have any
> visuals. This will be a very informal, conversational session, so expect that
> there will be some back and forth as we stop and ask questions and such. To
> get an idea of the format, imagine that somebody has just joined your team
> and you need to explain a system your team owns, or perhaps an executive has
> asked you to explain some concept to them."

If possible, we find it very valuable to have the hiring manager personally
conduct all of the Verbal Communication interview sessions. While we do have a
scoring rubric that aims to be as objective as possible, this session has a
higher degree of subjectivity than most. Having one person conduct all the
interviews helps to create a more consistent set of evaluations across
candidates.

### Final Selection

To make the final selection, the hiring manager schedules a meeting with the
recruiters, any interviewers who are interested in attending, and any other
parties we feel should be involved.

Ahead of time, they prepare a spreadsheet of the candidates in a suggested
stacked rank order, including summaries of their feedback at each step and any
additional comments or observations that seem relevant. Generally, the ordering
should follow the scoring from the interviews, but there are reasons why you
might choose to deviate from that.  For example, perhaps a candidate scored well
but had behavioral red flags, or perhaps they didn't score quite as well as
another candidate, but had relevant non-programming job experience that the
other candidate lacked and were thus ranked higher.

At the meeting, the manager lays out the reasoning for their ordering, and asks
for feedback or other impressions. Based on feedback, they adjust the ordering
as appropriate. At the end of the meeting, the selection is fixed and the top
candidates are informed that they have been accepted to the program. If some of
them end up accepting other offers or are otherwise no longer available, we'll
reach out to the next person on the list. Once we have enough accepted offers to
fill out a cohort, then we inform the other finalists that, though it was a
close decision, they have not been selected.

Even for folks who don't make it into the program, though, that's not
necessarily the end of our interactions with those candidates. For one thing,
anybody is welcome to apply again, regardless of how far they got on their
first try. Also, anybody who makes it to the final selection is somebody we
think is exceptional. If a candidate is interested, then as we see other roles
throughout the company that we think they may be a good fit for, we'll reach
out to those managers to let them know that that candidate did well in the
Ignite interviews.

With this volume of applications, and this caliber of candidates, final
decisions often come down to the thinnest of margins. Honestly, it will often
just depend on how well one candidate or another happened to show up on that
particular day for that particular interview. It can be difficult to make such
significant decisions based on this. However, hiring decisions must be made one
way or another, and judging based on criteria that are as fair, objective, and
rigorous as we know how to make them is probably the best way we can do it.
