title: About

Hi! My name is John Hyland (they/them), and I am the Director of New Relic's
Ignite Program, an early career incubator team focused on hiring folks into the
first (or nearly first) software engineering roles and giving them the support
they need to succeed. Before that, I was a software engineer for twenty-ish
years, focusing mostly in the areas of networking, security, database
internals, service architecture, and API design. I love working with complex
systems, teaching, making things, and having a positive impact on people's
lives. I believe strongly in the importance of community in building strong
engineering cultures. In my spare time, I'm also a blacksmith, a club DJ, and a
collector of extra hobbies.
