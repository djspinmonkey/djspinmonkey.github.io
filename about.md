John Hyland (they/them) is the former director of the New Relic's Ignite
program for early career engineers. Previous to that, they spent a couple
decades as a software engineer, focusing mostly on networking, security, and
service architectures.  They believe strongly in the importance of culture and
community building for the long-term success of both individual companies and
the tech industry at large.
